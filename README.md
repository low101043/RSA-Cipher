# RSA-Cipher  

Program which implements the RSA Cipher.  Can send messages with own special key.  Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) to see how it works.  

## Pre Conditions

- termcolor
- Python >= 3

## Notes:

- If you want to run it and send messages please use https://repl.it/@NathanielLowis/RSA-Cipher#MainProgram/keys.csv.  This is the same code on an online server thus the database stays. 
- This is not a secure version as the numbers used are too small

- If you run the program the CSV which is used is MainProgram/keys.csv.  Please either change the name or make the file in MainProgram (from where you start)
